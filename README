This plugin is very much inspired by Tim Pope's pathogen (vimscript#2332) and complements it with the functionality of loading infrequently used plugins later.

You can use pathogen's settings to configure ipi, e.g. disable plugins completely.

For loading plugins later, install them in ~/.vim/ipi (or ~\vimfiles\ipi). Adding `call ipi#inspect()` to your .vimrc. It will create a list of all plugins that can be loaded later on by using the LL command:

Load gundo plugin later:
:LL gundo

Load gundo and speeddating plugins later:
:LL gundo speedating

Load all known plugins later:
:LL!
